            <h3>Fall Family Photos<br/> 
               "She makes my kids laugh! "</h3>
            <p>"I dreaded photos, but Jacquelyn has a way with kids that just captures real raw moments. You just cannot pose people for the real life moments that she captures."       -Porter Family </p>
            <h3>Summer 2020 Wedding<br/>
               "SO glad she was there" </h3>
            <p>"Jacquelyn captured our day perfectly, she was always the only one for the job and when we told her we wanted a sparkler exit we saw the fear and determination in her eyes. She nailed them. She is our photoographer for life." -Bowen </p>
            <h3>Family session #12<br/>
               "We keep calling her back"</h3>
            <p>"Since 2014 we have been calling Jacquelyn various places to do photos for all sorts of lifetime memories. New babies from maternity to announcement to newborn photos as well as pre deployment photos and mommy and me, welcome home daddy, she is there for it all and she is part of our family now!" - Yates family  </p>
            <h3>Extended Family<br/>
               "She got lost and it added to the moment" </h3>
            <p>"We have know Jacquelyn since she became friends with our daughter in elementary school. We hired her for extended family photos and she got lost when navigation took her to a field. With no signal we had to go find her. It was worth the laugh because our land with her eye was priceless. Amazing photos." -Dewitt family </p>
            <h3>Senior class 2022<br/>
              "The best last minute decision" </h3>
            <p>"My uncle and grandma knew Jacquelyn and they recommended her for my senior photos. It was a beautiful day and Jacquelyn walked our property for hours making sure we got all the right angles. She was so fun and I absolutely love all my senior photos. Her help did not end there either. She helped me design my announcements and pointed me in the right direction for affordable printing as well." - Shimmer</p>
